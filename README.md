# WA-Chat-Analysis-1
Analysis of WhatsApp chats (obtained by exporting the chats from inbox) and determining basic patterns and trends of the senders

<br>
This can be gotten rid of while parsing the file and it would enable us to extend the analysis to analyze group chats by making minimal changes.
